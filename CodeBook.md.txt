1. Project Description:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

2. Study Design
2.1 Data Collection:

The data was collected from the below location and unzipped before processing.

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

2.2 Summary choices, experimental study design and transformation:

The data is loaded using R functions and all the data are looked throuroghly by different summary analysis such as summary, str, head, tail, etc functions. Further the data is verified to see whether Na, NaN are present or not. After, we get some level of understanding of the data the run_analysis.R script was written.

Below are process of the run_analysis.R script. The same is present in the README.md file also.

The run_analysis.R script is straight forward and single script to generate the tidy data from the raw data. 
It expects the below things:
1. The raw data is already downloaded and unzipped so that it does not has to download and unzip it each time the script is run.
2. No directory structure is changed after unzipping the files. 

The run_analysis.R script could be placed directly in the main direcory of unzipped files. It could be placed any other place also. However, in that case it would be expect that path the raw directory is set using setwd() command.

Below steps explains the steps followed by the script to generate the tidy data from raw data

1. Load the libraries
2. Declare and reset some of the variables used in the script
3. Load different data files such as features.txt, activity_labels.txt, X_train.txt, y_train.txt, X_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_train.txt amd subject_test.txt
4. It names the variables in the data set immediately after the data is loaded. It renames some of the variables from the feature list to make it more readable and later replaceable
5. Adds new column to show the activity labels for each of the activity id in the y_train and y_test data
6. Binds the Subject_Id, Acitivity Id, Activity Labels and all the feature variables for the training and test data
7. Merge the training and test data to create the merge data set
8. Grep for the feature list for mean and standard deviation and apply a subset to retrieve only these data in addition to subject_Id and activity_Labels
9. Create the tidy data set. This will create a table of data for each subject and activity labels and
show the average of all the feature list
10. Write the table of tidy data set into the current working directory with a name 'averaged_tidy_data.txt' and the values are separated by tab

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ

Subject_Id: Basically an identifier for the subjects undergoing the process. The values range from 1 to 30.

Activity_Label: Values indicating the different types of activity the subjects were doing. The values are 
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

All the other measurements are for mean and standard deviations of the subjects underdoing different activity. The measurements are in terms Hz and x,y and z to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. If the varialble name is followed.
